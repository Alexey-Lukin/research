🌌 Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework and computational proof-of-concept for the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) model. We propose a fundamentally new solution to the dark matter problem: identifying it as the gravitational backreaction of information archival in a discrete causal substrate.

By scaling the Memory Burden effect (Dvali et al. 2025) to global cosmological scales, the framework derives observed galactic dark matter densities from information-theoretic principles without invoking new particle candidates.

🧬 Key Theoretical Pillars

1. Generally Covariant Effective Action

The model introduces a coordinate-invariant formulation where the archival energy density is integrated into the Einstein-Hilbert action via a dimensionless Information Archival Intensity scalar $\mathcal{I}(x) \equiv \gamma_{\mathcal{A}}/H$.


$$\rho_{dm}(x) \cong \alpha \cdot \rho_{crit} \cdot \left[ \mathcal{I}(x) \cdot \ell_P^3 \right]$$

2. Scale-Invariant Coupling ($\eta \approx 10^{-14}$)

Addressing the "fine-tuning" problem, we derive the archival efficiency $\eta$ as a geometric ratio between the UV substrate scale and the IR cosmological horizon. This represents the branching ratio of local informational updates that effectively transition the global 11D moduli configuration.

3. Falsifiable Prediction: The Post-Starburst Signature

The CCA framework predicts that dark matter density is history-dependent.

The Signature: Post-Starburst (E+A) galaxies—systems with a massive starburst in their integrated history but low current luminosity—must exhibit a $1.5\text{--}2\times$ higher dark matter fraction than quiescent galaxies of equal baryonic mass.

Testability: This is directly testable using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data from the MaNGA and SAMI surveys.
