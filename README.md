Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) Research

Status: Submission-Ready (Version 7.8)

Scientific Basis: Tensor Effective Field Theory / Information Cosmology

Target Journals: JCAP / Physical Review D

Author: Alexey Lukin

🌌 Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework for the CCA Framework, which identifies Dark Matter as the emergent gravitational backreaction of information archival in a discrete causal substrate.

By defining the "Archival Burden" as a generally covariant tensor field coupled to the local scalar curvature $R$, the model derives observed galactic dynamics and local dark matter densities from information-theoretic principles, without the need for additional particle candidates.

🧬 Key Theoretical Upgrades (v7.8)

1. Tensor Formulation ($T_{\mu\nu}$)

We have derived the archival stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{archival}$ from the variation of the archival action. We demonstrate that in the late-time limit, the archival ghost behaves as a pressureless fluid with an equation of state $w = p/\rho \approx 0$, fulfilling the requirements for Cold Dark Matter (CDM).

2. Local Covariance

The model ensures coordinate invariance by coupling the archival intensity $\mathcal{I}(x)$ to the local scalar curvature $R$:


$$\mathcal{I}(x) \equiv \frac{\gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(x)}{\sqrt{R/6}}$$


This replaces the global Hubble parameter used in earlier versions, making the theory mathematically rigorous for General Relativity.

3. Bullet Cluster Resolution

The CCA framework provides a quantitative explanation for the Bullet Cluster. Since archival rates are driven by interaction intensity, stellar populations (high archival density) carry a much larger "Archival Ghost" than diffuse gas. This explains why gravitational lensing centers follow the collisionless stars rather than the dissipative plasma.

4. Falsifiable Prediction: The E+A Signature

The model's core test is the history-dependence of dark matter density.

The Prediction: Post-starburst (E+A) galaxies must exhibit a $1.8 \pm 0.2 \times$ higher dark matter fraction compared to quiescent galaxies of equal baryonic mass.

Verification: This is testable using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data from MaNGA and SAMI surveys.

🛠 Strategic Terminal (v3.9)

The interactive tool research.html (WebGL-based) visualizes the Integrated Burden logic:

Integrated History: Toggle the "Starburst" mode to observe how past entropy events leave a permanent "Archival Ghost" in the gravitational potential, even after the star formation rate drops.

Gaia Calibration: Real-time alignment with the latest Gaia DR3 solar neighborhood benchmarks ($8.4 \times 10^{-22} \text{ kg/m}^3$).
