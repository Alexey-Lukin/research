🌌 Abstract

This repository contains the theoretical framework and computational proof-of-concept for the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) model. We propose a fundamentally new solution to the dark matter problem: identifying it as the gravitational backreaction of information archival in a resource-constrained computational universe.

By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action with a generally covariant "Archival Burden" term, we derive observed galactic dark matter densities from first principles. Unlike standard $\Lambda$CDM, which requires cold particles, the CCA framework identifies mass-energy density as the physical "energy bill" for maintaining the universe's archived history.

🧬 Core Theoretical Pillars

1. The Archival Fraction ($\eta \approx 10^{-14}$)

While thermodynamic entropy production ($\dot{S}$) is vast, the substrate's causal history log is sparse. We derive an Archival Efficiency ($\eta \approx 10^{-14}$) as a geometric ratio between the Hubble scale and the substrate scale, representing the branching ratio of local causal updates that effectively alter the global moduli configuration.

2. The Covariant Action & Intensity ($\mathcal{I}$)

The model introduces a dimensionless Information Archival Intensity scalar $\mathcal{I}(x) \equiv \gamma_{\mathcal{A}}/H$. The effective dark matter density is then given by:


$$\rho_{dm}(x) \cong \alpha \cdot \rho_{crit} \cdot \left[ \mathcal{I}(x) \cdot \ell_P^3 \right]$$


where $\alpha \approx 10^8$ is the hierarchy factor anchored to the Grand Unification (GUT) scale ($10^{15}$ GeV).

3. Falsifiable Prediction: The "Killer" Signature

The CCA framework predicts that dark matter density is history-dependent.

Prediction: Post-Starburst (E+A) galaxies—systems with high integrated entropy history but low current luminosity—must exhibit a $1.5\times$ to $2\times$ higher dark matter fraction than quiescent galaxies of equal baryonic mass. This is testable with existing MaNGA and SAMI survey data.

📊 Quantitative Verification

The model reproduces local benchmarks with no ad-hoc tuning:

Predicted Halo Density: $1.0 \times 10^{-21} \text{ kg/m}^3$

Observed (Gaia DR3 Benchmark): $\approx 0.4 \text{ GeV/cm}^3$ ($\approx 10^{-21} \text{ kg/m}^3$).

Dynamics: Naturally explains the Bullet Cluster (DM follows the information-rich stellar path) and the Cusp-Core problem.
