Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) Research

This repository contains the scientific framework and computational terminal for the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) model (v7.2). This research introduces a non-equilibrium, information-theoretic approach to M-theory moduli stabilization and the nature of Dark Matter.

🧬 Scientific Framework

1. Dark Matter as Archival Burden

We propose that dark matter is not a particle, but the gravitational backreaction of information archival in a resource-constrained computational universe. With an archival efficiency of 

$$\eta \approx 10^{-14}$$

, the model derives observed dark matter densities (

$$\rho_{dm} \approx 10^{-21}$$

 kg/m³) from first principles.

2. GUT-Scale Calibration (

$$\alpha \approx 10^8$$

)

By anchoring the framework to the Grand Unification (GUT) scale (

$$10^{15}$$

 GeV), we establish a natural hierarchy factor. This explains the observed ratio between dark matter and baryonic matter without ad hoc particles.

3. Falsifiable Prediction: The Post-Starburst Excess

Unlike standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM), the CCA framework predicts a unique correlation between a galaxy's integrated entropy history and its dark matter fraction. Post-Starburst (E+A) galaxies are predicted to exhibit a 

$$1.5\text{--}2\times$$

 higher dark matter fraction than quiescent galaxies of equal mass.

🛠 Simulation: CCA Research Terminal (v3.3)

The primary simulation tool is included as research.html.

Features:

Substrate Physics: Visualizing MBL-stabilization and Floquet-driven moduli.

Archival Analyzer: Demonstrating how volume-law history archival generates flat rotation curves (

$$M \propto r$$

).

📊 Quantitative Benchmarks

Halo Density: Matches Gaia-derived observations (

$$\rho_{dm} \approx 10^{-21}$$

 kg/m³) using 

$$\alpha = 10^8$$

.

Spectral Scaling: Emergent power spectrum consistent with 

$$k^{-3}$$

 CDM clustering.

NESS Stability: Stable for 

$$>10^5$$

 Floquet cycles.
