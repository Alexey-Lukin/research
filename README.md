Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) Research

This repository contains the theoretical framework and computational proof-of-concept for the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) model. This project explores a non-equilibrium, information-theoretic approach to M-theory moduli stabilization and the emergence of Dark Matter.

🌌 Overview

Traditional approaches to the string landscape often rely on static flux compactification. The CCA framework proposes a dynamical alternative: the universe operates as a resource-constrained computational system. By replacing stochastic randomness with a Deterministic Floquet Schedule, the model investigates how cyclical dynamics can stabilize high-dimensional moduli and generate emergent gravitational phenomena.

🧬 Scientific Framework

1. MBL-Protected Floquet Moduli

Utilizing Many-Body Localization (MBL), the model demonstrates how the internal 11D moduli sector remains stable against Floquet heating. This creates a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS) that prevents vacuum decay, acting as a discrete time crystal at the substrate level.

2. Dark Matter as Archival Burden

We propose that dark matter is not a particle, but the gravitational backreaction of information archival in the causal substrate. With an archival efficiency of $\eta \approx 10^{-14}$ and a hierarchy factor $\alpha \approx 10^8$ (GUT-scale calibrated), the model derives observed dark matter densities ($10^{-21}$ kg/m³) from first principles.

3. Wavefunction Collapse as "Lazy Evaluation"

The framework interprets wavefunction collapse as a Resource Optimization Protocol. The system maintains a low-cost unitary superposition and only "renders" definitive states when informational queries demand causal consistency, minimizing global algorithmic depth.

📊 Quantitative Benchmarks

Halo Density: Matches Gaia-derived observations ($\rho_{dm} \approx 10^{-21}$ kg/m³) using the $\alpha=10^8$ hierarchy factor.

Spectral Scaling: Emergent power spectrum consistent with $k^{-3}$ CDM clustering.

Stability: NESS maintained for $>10^5$ Floquet cycles in localized phases.

📚 Falsifiable Predictions

A unique signature of this model is the Post-Starburst Excess. The CCA framework predicts that galaxies with a high "Entropy History" but low current star-formation activity (E+A galaxies) will exhibit anomalously high dark matter fractions compared to quiescent galaxies of equal mass.
