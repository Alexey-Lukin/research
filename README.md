Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) Research

This repository contains the computational framework and simulation data for the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) model. This project explores a non-equilibrium approach to string vacuum stability, dark matter emergence, and the measurement problem through the lens of information physics and holographic complexity.

🌌 Overview

Traditional approaches to the string landscape often rely on static flux compactification. The CCA framework proposes a dynamical alternative: the "Software Layer" of the 11D substrate operates as a Discrete Topological Automaton. By replacing stochastic randomness with a Deterministic Floquet Schedule, the model investigates how cyclical dynamics can stabilize high-dimensional moduli and generate emergent cosmological structures.

🧬 Core Hypotheses

1. MBL-Protected Floquet Moduli

We propose that internal Calabi-Yau moduli are driven by high-frequency Floquet dynamics. To prevent thermalization (the "heating problem"), the moduli space is protected by Many-Body Localization (MBL).

Mechanism: This creates a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS) where moduli act as a Discrete Time Crystal (DTC).

Result: Analogous to a Kapitza pendulum, this stabilization provides a dynamical path to satisfying de Sitter constraints without traditional "rolling" instabilities.

2. Volume-Law Memory Burden (Dark Matter)

Dark Matter is interpreted as the gravitational backreaction of archived informational states (cosmological history).

Mechanism: Causal history is encoded via Volume-Law Entanglement, exceeding the standard holographic area-law.

Result: Simulations show that this "Inert Information" mimics Cold Dark Matter (CDM) clustering patterns, exhibiting a characteristic $k^{-3}$ scaling in the power spectrum.

3. Resource-Theoretic Wavefunction Collapse

A modification of the "Complexity equals Action" (CA) conjecture where wavefunction collapse is viewed as a Resource Optimization Protocol.

Mechanism: The system minimizes Algorithmic Depth (Kolmogorov Complexity) through Lazy Evaluation.

Result: Definitive states are rendered only when informational queries demand causal consistency, providing a resource-theoretic basis for state reduction.
