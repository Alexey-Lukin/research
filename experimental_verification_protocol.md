Experimental Verification Protocol for Theorem I (MCE)

Target: Statistical Validation of the $1.8\pm0.2$ Archival Excess

Lead Theorist: Alexey Lukin

Methodology: Comparative Dynamical Mass Modeling (IFU Data)

1. Objective

To empirically verify the correlation between a galaxy's star-formation history and its dark matter fraction ($f_{dm}$), as predicted by the CCA Archival Burden theory.

2. Data Sources & Sample Selection

We require high-resolution Integral Field Unit (IFU) data to decouple baryonic and dark mass.

Primary Survey: SDSS-IV MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory).

Sample A (Post-Starburst/E+A): 500+ galaxies identified by strong Balmer absorption and lack of emission lines (quenched burst at $z \approx 0.5$).

Sample B (Control/Quiescent): 500+ elliptical galaxies matched with Sample A by Stellar Mass ($M_*$), Redshift, and Sersic Index.

3. Methodology: Mass Decomposition

We will use Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) to determine the total dynamical mass within the effective radius ($R_e$):

Luminosity Profiles: Use SDSS $r$-band imaging to build the Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) of the stellar surface brightness.

Kinematics: Extract stellar velocity dispersion maps ($\sigma$) and rotation curves from MaNGA data cubes.

Bayesian Inference: Run MCMC simulations to find the best fit for:


$$M_{dyn}(<R_e) = M_{stellar} + M_{dark}$$


where $M_{stellar}$ is constrained by stellar population synthesis (SPS) models.

4. The CCA Prediction vs. Standard CDM

We define the Archival Surplus Ratio ($\mathcal{R}$):


$$\mathcal{R} = \frac{(M_{dark}/M_{stellar})_{E+A}}{(M_{dark}/M_{stellar})_{Control}}$$

Standard $\Lambda$CDM Prediction: $\mathcal{R} \approx 1.0 \pm 0.1$ (Dark matter halo properties are independent of recent starburst history).

CCA Theorem Prediction: $\mathcal{R} \approx 1.8 \pm 0.2$ (The recent starburst left a permanent informational backreaction surplus).

5. Statistical Falsification Criteria

Success: A measured $\mathcal{R} > 1.5$ with a significance of $> 5\sigma$. This would constitute direct evidence for the history-integrated nature of dark matter.

Falsification: A measured $\mathcal{R} \approx 1.0$ within error bars. This would indicate that dark matter is likely a particle (WIMP) or a modification of gravity that does not preserve information memory.

6. Global Implications

If $\mathcal{R} \approx 1.8$ is confirmed, it proves that:

Dark Matter is an archival record of baryonic entropy.

The fundamental constant $\eta \approx 10^{-14}$ is the universal efficiency of the vacuum's archival system.

The universe is a computational substrate governed by the MCE Theorem.
