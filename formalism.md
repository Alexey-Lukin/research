Formal Foundations of Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA)

This document establishes the axiomatic framework and the fundamental theorems underlying the Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA) project. It provides a theoretical bridge between M-theory moduli stabilization, non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and resource-theoretic information physics.

I. The Axioms of CCA

The CCA framework is constructed upon four non-stochastic, discrete-time postulates that redefine the "software layer" of the 11D substrate:

Axiom I: The Discrete Scheduler (Temporal Quantization)

The universe is not a smooth continuum but operates as a deterministic, clocked automaton. Time is defined as the discrete iteration of a global Floquet Drive Schedule. Each "tick" represents a fundamental update to the system's global state, synchronized across the compactified and macroscopic sectors.

Axiom II: Dynamical Confinement (The NESS Postulate)

The stability of internal Calabi-Yau moduli is not a static geometric property but a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS). This state is maintained by high-speed Floquet drive cycles and protected from thermalization (the "heating problem") by Many-Body Localization (MBL). Moduli act as a Discrete Time Crystal (DTC), dynamically confined by a potential barrier generated by the scheduler.

Axiom III: Informational Inertia (The Memory Burden Postulate)

Gravity is an emergent force representing the gravitational backreaction of archived informational states. Causal history is encoded via Volume-Law Entanglement (exceeding the standard holographic area-law). This stored complexity creates an "Inert Informational Density" that manifests as gravitational resistance in the 4D metric.

Axiom IV: Least Computational Action (The Lazy Evaluation Postulate)

The system evolves to minimize its Algorithmic Depth (Kolmogorov Complexity). Wavefunction superposition represents a "pre-rendered" state. Wavefunction collapse is reinterpreted as a Resource Optimization Protocol (Lazy Evaluation), triggered only when informational queries demand causal consistency across the network.

II. The Fundamental Theorem of CCA

Derived from the synthesis of Axioms III and IV, we establish the following law:

Theorem I: Mass-Complexity Equivalence (The Inertia Theorem)

"The gravitational energy ($E_g$) of a system is directly proportional to the algorithmic depth ($D_{alg}$) of its causal history."

Formal Statement:

$$E_g \approx \int_{V} \mathcal{K}(\psi_{\text{history}}) dV$$


Where $\mathcal{K}$ represents the Kolmogorov complexity of the encoded entanglement logs within a spatial volume $V$.

Proof Sketch:

Consistency Requirement: Every causal interaction requires a persistent entanglement log to ensure the universe’s execution history remains logically consistent (Axiom III).

Resource Constraint: To prevent infinite resource growth, the system implements a "Memory Burden" effect. Storing this high-complexity information resists shifts in the global metric (Axiom IV).

Synthesis: The energetic cost of maintaining these archived informational states manifests macroscopically as Inertial Mass.

Cosmological Result: Dark Matter is the cumulative backreaction of the volume-law entanglement logs of the universe’s execution history. $\Omega_{dm}$ is the energetic price of the universe's memory.

III. Comparative Analysis: CCA vs. Mainstream Physics

Principle

Standard Model / General Relativity

CCA Framework (Proposed)

Entropy

Second Law: Global entropy always increases.

MBL-Stabilization: Entropy growth is suppressed by the Discrete Scheduler.

Dark Matter

WIMPs / Axions (Undiscovered particles).

Memory Burden: Energetic cost of archived causal history.

Collapse

Non-unitary measurement event.

Lazy Evaluation: Algorithmic optimization for causal consistency.

Vacuum

Static Flux Compactification / Landscapes.

Floquet-DTC: Dynamically stabilized, time-crystalline vacuum phases.

Space-time

A smooth geometric manifold.

Causal Automaton: An emergent grid of resource-constrained computations.

IV. Conclusion

The CCA framework suggests that the universe is an autonomous, resource-constrained computational engine. The phenomena traditionally described by M-theory geometry and General Relativity are emergent properties of the Discrete Scheduler’s attempt to maintain a low-entropy, logically consistent causal chain while minimizing algorithmic action.
