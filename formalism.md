Theorem I: The Mass-Complexity Equivalence (MCE)

Context: Framework of Cyclical Causal Automata (CCA)

Formalism: Circuit Complexity & Effective Field Theory

Version: 4.0 (The Rigorous Formulation)

1. Abstract

We propose that the phenomenon of Dark Matter is an emergent effect of Quantum Circuit Complexity accumulation. The vacuum substrate, acting as a resource-constrained computational engine, exhibits an effective gravitational mass density proportional to the local rate of complexity growth.

2. Fundamental Constants & Scales

To resolve dimensional consistency, we anchor the theorem to fundamental string theory parameters:

Planck Mass ($M_P$): $\approx 1.2 \times 10^{19}$ GeV

String Mass Scale ($M_s$): $\approx 10^{17}$ GeV (in high-scale phenomenology)

The Hierarchy Factor ($\alpha$):


$$\alpha \equiv \left( \frac{M_P}{M_s} \right)^2 \approx 10^8$$


This factor represents the projection of 10D string complexity onto the 4D effective field theory.

Screening Scale ($L_{scr}$):
The characteristic length scale over which quantum information is screened. In a galactic context, this relates to the local curvature radius:


$$L_{scr} \approx \frac{c}{\sqrt{4\pi G \rho_{total}}}$$

3. Statement of the Theorem

"The effective gravitational mass density ($\rho_{eff}$) induced by information processing is proportional to the Complexity Growth Rate density ($\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}$), scaled by the string hierarchy factor."

$$\rho_{eff} \cong \frac{\alpha}{c^2} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{L_{scr}^3} \cdot \Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}$$

Where $\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}} = \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dV dt}$ represents the local density of computational operations per unit volume per second.

4. Derivation of Flat Rotation Curves

Problem: Standard volume-law complexity ($\mathcal{C} \propto r^3$) implies $M(r) \propto r^3$, which would yield solid-body rotation ($v \propto r$), not flat curves.

Resolution:
The complexity growth rate $\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}(r)$ is not uniform. It is driven by interactions within the baryonic matter distribution. For a typical galaxy, the interaction density drops with radius.
If the computational activity follows an isothermal profile ($\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}} \propto r^{-2}$), then:

Density Profile:


$$\rho_{eff}(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$

Enclosed Mass:


$$M_{eff}(r) = \int_0^r 4\pi x^2 \rho_{eff}(x) dx \propto \int_0^r \text{const} \, dx \propto r$$

Orbital Velocity:


$$v^2 = \frac{G M_{eff}(r)}{r} \propto \frac{r}{r} = \text{const}$$

Result: The CCA framework naturally reproduces flat rotation curves ($v \approx \text{const}$) assuming the complexity growth is driven by local baryonic interactions that screen the holographic horizon.

5. Testable Predictions

Galactic Age Correlation:
Since $\rho_{eff} \propto \int \Gamma_{\mathcal{C}} dt$, older galaxies (integrated over time $t$) must exhibit a higher Dark Matter fraction ($M_{dm}/M_b$) than younger galaxies of the same mass.

Metallicity Correlation:
Galactic metallicity is a proxy for integrated star formation history (and thus computational history). The theory predicts a strong positive correlation between metallicity and the "Dark Matter Halo" density.

The Bullet Cluster:
Dark Matter should follow the path of maximum informational complexity (stellar history), which may distinctively lag behind collisional gas but remain attached to collisionless stars, consistent with observations.

6. Conclusion

Gravity acts as the "thermodynamic cost" of maintaining the logical consistency of the universe's causal history. The "missing mass" is simply the physical weight of the universe's memory, scaled by the efficiency of the string substrate ($\alpha \approx 10^8$).
