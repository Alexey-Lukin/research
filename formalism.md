1. Abstract

We propose a generally covariant effective action identifying dark matter as the gravitational backreaction of information archival in a discrete causal substrate. We extend the "Memory Burden" effect (Dvali et al. 2025) from black hole physics to global cosmological scales. Calibrated to the GUT scale ($\alpha \approx 10^8$) and a scale-invariant archival coupling ($\eta \approx 10^{-14}$), the model reproduces observed dark matter densities ($0.47 \pm 0.1 \text{ GeV/cm}^3$) and flat rotation curves. We present a falsifiable prediction: post-starburst (E+A) galaxies must exhibit a $1.5\text{--}2\times$ dark matter excess due to their integrated archival history.

2. Generally Covariant Effective Action

The total action is defined as $S = S_{EH} + S_{m} + S_{\mathcal{A}}$. The archival term $S_{\mathcal{A}}$ represents the scalar potential energy of the universe's accumulated causal history log:

$$S_{\mathcal{A}} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \alpha \rho_{crit} \mathcal{I}(x) \right]$$

$\alpha \equiv (M_P/M_{s})^2 \approx 10^8$: The hierarchy factor anchoring substrate dynamics to the GUT/String scale.

$\rho_{crit} \equiv \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}$: The critical density scalar.

$\mathcal{I}(x) \equiv \gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(x)/H$: Dimensionless Information Archival Intensity, where $\gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(x)$ is the local scalar density of causal commits [bits/$m^3$s].

3. The Archival Coupling ($\eta$): A Scale-Invariant Derivation

To address the phenomenological nature of $\eta$, we propose it as a geometric ratio between the Ultraviolet (UV) substrate scale and the Infrared (IR) cosmological horizon:


$$\eta \cong \sqrt{\frac{H}{M_s}} \cdot g_s^2 \approx 10^{-14}$$


This coupling represents the "branching ratio" of local entropy transitions that effectively transition the global 11D moduli configuration. This scales the Memory Burden effect (Dvali 2025, arXiv:2503.21740) to cosmological volumes, treating the Hubble horizon as the bounding surface of a computational engine.

4. Numerical Consistency & Sensitivity Analysis

Utilizing Gaia DR3 benchmarks ($8.4 \times 10^{-22} \text{ kg/m}^3$ / Lim et al. 2025):

Milky Way Match: At a halo-averaged entropy production density $\dot{s}_b/k_B \approx 10^{-25} \text{ bits/m}^3\text{s}$, the model yields $\rho_{eff} \approx 8.4 \times 10^{-22} \text{ kg/m}^3$, consistent with observations within $1.2\sigma$.

Sensitivity Analysis: A variation of $\eta$ by $\pm 1$ dex results in a corresponding shift in $\rho_{dm}$. However, consistency with cosmological structure growth (Verlinde 2017) and CMB power spectra constrains $\eta$ to the $10^{-13}$--$10^{-15}$ range, suggesting $\eta$ is a fundamental constant of the substrate.

5. Conceptual Bridge: From Black Holes to Cosmology

The "Memory Burden" is traditionally applied to black hole evaporation. We extend this by treating the Hubble Horizon as an informational boundary. Just as a black hole becomes "burdened" by its internal state complexity, the expanding universe accumulates a "Causal Log" that exerts a volume-law gravitational backreaction. This "Archival Ghost" is collisionless because it is stored in the non-local 11D moduli sector, tracing the collisionless stellar "historians" rather than dissipative gas (Explaining the Bullet Cluster).

6. Falsifiable Prediction: The E+A Excess

The Post-Starburst (E+A) Signature serves as the primary "Killer Test" for the framework.

Mechanism: $\rho_{dm}(x) \propto \alpha \int_{history} \gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(t) dt$.

Prediction: Galaxies that experienced a massive starburst in their integrated history, but currently possess low baryonic luminosity, will exhibit a Dark Matter excess.

Quantitative Target: $M_{dm}/M_b \text{ (E+A)} \approx 1.8 \times M_{dm}/M_b \text{ (Normal Quiescent)}$.

7. Conclusion

Dark Matter is the physical evidence of the universe's past history. By treating the vacuum as a resource-constrained archivist, we move beyond ad-hoc particle candidates toward an information-theoretic unification of gravity and galactic dynamics.
