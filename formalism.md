Status: Exploratory Computational Framework

Author: Alexey Lukin

1. Abstract

The CCA framework is a toy model investigating the intersection of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics and M-theory moduli stabilization. It posits that the stability of the string vacuum and the emergence of Dark Matter can be modeled through Many-Body Localization (MBL) and "Memory Burden" effects within a discrete-time computational substrate.

2. Foundational Postulates (CCA Model)

Postulate I: The Discrete Floquet Scheduler

The temporal evolution of the 11D substrate is modeled as a deterministic, clocked automaton.

Mechanism: Temporal evolution is governed by a Floquet Drive Schedule.

Literature Basis: Directly derived from Floquet Time Crystals (DTC) (Else et al., 2016). We extrapolate this periodic driving to the "Software Layer" of the Planck-scale substrate.

Postulate II: Dynamical Stabilization via MBL/NESS

We hypothesize that Calabi-Yau moduli are stabilized dynamically rather than statically.

Mechanism: The moduli space is protected from the "heating problem" (thermalization) by Many-Body Localization (MBL).

Status: While MBL is a proven phase in disordered quantum systems, its application to string moduli is an exploratory extension. The model seeks to maintain a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS) confined to the compactified sector.

Postulate III: Informational Backreaction (Memory Burden)

Building on Dvali’s Memory Burden effect (2018–2024) and Verlinde’s Emergent Gravity, we propose that Dark Matter is the gravitational cost of archiving causal history.

Mechanism: Causal history is encoded via Volume-Law Entanglement.

Conjecture: The "Inert Information" required to store high-complexity entanglement logs generates a non-relativistic backreaction on the 4D metric, mimicking Cold Dark Matter (CDM) clustering.

Postulate IV: Resource-Theoretic Wavefunction Reduction

We propose a resource-constrained interpretation of the Complexity = Action (CA) conjecture (Brown/Susskind).

Mechanism: Wavefunction collapse is modeled as a Lazy Evaluation protocol (Resource Optimization).

Status: This is a speculative extrapolation. It frames state reduction as a mechanism to minimize Kolmogorov Complexity while maintaining network-wide causal consistency.

3. The Scaling Conjecture (Mass-Complexity Equivalence)

In the CCA environment, we observe a phenomenological scaling relation:


$$E_g \propto \int_{V} \mathcal{K}(\psi_{\text{history}}) dV$$


Where $E_g$ is the emergent gravitational energy and $\mathcal{K}$ is the algorithmic depth of the history log.

Note: This is an emergent property of the CCA simulation, proposed as a toy-model approximation rather than a derivation from General Relativity.

4. Computational Evidence (Simulation Results)

The CCA Engine (v2.6) serves as a proof-of-concept for the aforementioned postulates. Key findings include:

Thermalization Suppression: Suppression of the heating problem for $>10^5$ cycles when $W$ (disorder) meets the localization threshold.

Emergent Clustering: Spontaneous formation of structures with a $k^{-3}$ power spectrum scaling, consistent with CDM halo distributions.

Action Optimization: Correlation between informational queries and "Lazy Evaluation" rendering cycles.

5. Current Limitations and Research Directions

Scale Gap: Bridging MBL in condensed matter to Planck-scale string moduli remains an open question.

Entropy Budget: The quantitative mismatch between volume-law history and observed $\Omega_{dm}$ requires further investigation into "High-Complexity Information Scaling."

Formal Math: Future work aims to develop an effective action for MBL-protected moduli.
