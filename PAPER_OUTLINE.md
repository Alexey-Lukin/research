Target Journals: JCAP / Physical Review D

Version: 7.9 (Strategic Submission Build)

I. Introduction

The Crisis of ΛCDM: Summary of small-scale tensions (Cusp-Core, Missing Satellites) and the continued non-detection of WIMPs.

Hypothesis: Dark Matter as the "Memory Burden" (Dvali 2025) of the universe's causal history—a gravitational backreaction of information commits to a discrete 11D moduli substrate.

The Informational Paradigm: Shifting from "Dark Particles" to "Historical Inertia" within the framework of Information Cosmology.

Roadmap: A brief guide for reviewers on the paper's three major contributions: the covariant EFT, the Gaia DR3 consistency, and the E+A falsifiable prediction.

II. The Generally Covariant Formalism

Effective Action: Construction of the archival action term $S_{\mathcal{A}}$ integrated into the Einstein-Hilbert framework.

Diffeomorphism Invariance: Justification for coupling archival intensity $\mathcal{I}(x)$ to the local scalar curvature $R$, ensuring a coordinate-independent local scalar field.

The Stress-Energy Tensor: Explicit derivation of $T_{\mu\nu}^{archival}$ via metric variation.

The Dust Limit: Mathematical proof that archival mass manifests as a pressureless fluid ($w \approx 0$) in the late-time limit, satisfying the fundamental criteria for Cold Dark Matter (CDM).

Energy-Momentum Conservation: Verification of $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$.

III. Microphysics of the Archival Coupling

Strategic Ansatz: Proposing $\eta \cong g_s^2 (H/M_s)^{1/4}$ as a minimal, scale-invariant bridge between UV (Substrate) and IR (Hubble) scales.

Dimensional Consistency: Why the 1/4 exponent represents the simplest dimensionless bridge in brane-world overlap volumes.

Parameter Table: A transparent listing of all physical constants used ($M_P, M_s, g_s, H_0$) and the resulting hierarchy factor $\alpha \approx 10^8$.

IV. Astrophysical Consistency: Gaia DR3

Local Density Match: Fitting the CCA prediction to the $0.47 \pm 0.1 \text{ GeV/cm}^3$ solar neighborhood benchmark (Lim et al. 2025).

Sensitivity & Robustness: Analysis of how $\rho_{dm}$ responds to variations in substrate scale and archival efficiency, demonstrating that the model is not "fine-tuned" but "scale-determined."

V. Resolving Galactic and Cluster Anomalies

The Bullet Cluster Resolution: Order-of-magnitude derivation showing how the entropy flux ratio between stars and gas ($\dot{s}_{stars}/\dot{s}_{gas} \approx 10^2\text{--}10^3$) anchors DM to stars rather than dissipative plasma.

Emergent Flat Rotation Curves: Deriving the $M(r) \propto r$ profile from the radial archival gradient inherent in virialized baryonic distributions.

VI. The Killer Test: Post-Starburst (E+A) Galaxies

The History Integral: Quantitative SFR burst model demonstrating that $\rho_{dm} \propto \int \gamma_{\mathcal{A}} dt$.

The Falsifiable Signature: A predicted $1.8 \pm 0.2 \times$ dynamical-to-baryonic mass excess in E+A galaxies compared to quiescent systems.

Empirical Roadmap: Strategies for using MaNGA/SAMI Integral Field Unit (IFU) data to verify this correlation between integrated history and gravitational potential.
